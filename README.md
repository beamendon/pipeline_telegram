A **chatbot** is a type of software that interacts with users through automated conversations on messaging platforms like Telegram. **Telegram**, a freeware and mostly open-source instant messaging platform, provides an ideal environment for developing projects that involve interaction with large volumes of user-generated data.

The objective of this project is to **build a data pipeline** that can ingest, process, store, and expose messages from a Telegram group, enabling data professionals to conduct in-depth analyses of group interactions. The proposed architecture is divided into two complementary parts: the transactional layer, where messages are generated and collected on Telegram, and the analytical layer, where the data is processed and analyzed on Amazon Web Services (AWS).

This activity was a challenge proposed by EBAC as the Final Project for the Big Data and Cloud Computing Module.
